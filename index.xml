Now that I am entering my final year of my PhD, I will be begining this as a chronicle of projects, papers and conferences that influenced my time during my PhD.
This was my first accepted paper, I submitted it to the conference Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making in 2019. I attended the conference which was a great experience.</description></item></channel></rss>

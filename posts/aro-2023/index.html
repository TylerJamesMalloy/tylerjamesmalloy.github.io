One purpose of the workshop was to center human behavior and decision making in the discussion on where to take research into cyber deception. From my perspective, the future of cyber deception will involve in some way human decision making, whether as human in the loop systems or human on the loop systems, or as a reviewer and analyzer of the behavior of automated systems. This is an important reality to account for when thinking of the future of cyber deception, as oftentimes automated system design does not take into account the realities of human decision making.</p><p>While it may seem like humans have become less and less involved in areas relevant to cyber deception throughout the years, they still remain an important factor in key areas. One area that our lab is currently researching is in phishing, where human or automated systems attempt to leverage deception into compromising security in a variety of ways. In these instances, it is crucial to understand how humans evaluate the danger of potential instances of phishing, such as emails, as well as how new automated systems are being designed to thwart these defenses.</p><p>The remainder of this post is my personal notes of the presenters of this workshop. As always, these notes are my own thoughts and not necessarily claims made by the presenters.</p><h1 id=cognition-and-cyber-deception><strong>Cognition and Cyber Deception</strong></h1><h2 id=christian-lebierehttpswwwandrewcmueduuserclhomehtml><a href=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/cl/home.html>Christian Lebiere</a></h2><ul><li>Overview of Cognitive Architectures applied to predicting human decision making in cyber security tasks.</li><li>It is possible to determine the cost and benefits of cyber deception from an Instance-Based Learning model by querying it to determine the associated value.</li><li>Cognitive salience for explainable AI.

Christian: these cognitive models are adaptive and thus if the attack strategy changes the defender can adapt to the exploitation of the defender.</li><li>Methods in cognitive architecture can model and predict the behavior and decision making of other agents and then optimize their behavior in relation to the decisions made by those agents.</li><li>Differences in representation strategies between attackers and defenders can be important for predicting the behavior of opponents in complex cyber security contexts.</li><li>This could use our approach of theory of mind transfer of learning by gaining experience as the opponent and learning the representation strategy.</li></ul><h1 id=game-theory-systems-and-algorithms-for-cyber-deception><strong>Game Theory, Systems and Algorithms for Cyber Deception</strong></h1><h2 id=chris-kiekintveldhttpswwwcsutepedukiekintveld><a href=https://www.cs.utep.edu/kiekintveld/>Chris Kiekintveld</a></h2><ul><li>Attack graphs represent how attackers choose actions that move through a network or an environment that is under attack.</li><li>Zero day vulnerabilities can be defended against by taking existing attack graphs and adjusting them slightly to determine how best to defend against novel attacks that are similar to existing ones.</li><li>Targeted models of bounded rationality.

This can allow for breach detection once the user retries their password after a breach.</li><li>Another issue is when using passwords across different sites, if attackers get 2 sites they can tell which is real. To fix this we can detect remotely stuffed honeywords, but this can lead to security vulnerabilities if we just sent them all the passwords.</li></ul><h2 id=tiffany-baohttpsscaiengineeringasuedufacultycomputer-science-and-engineeringtiffany-bao><a href=https://scai.engineering.asu.edu/faculty/computer-science-and-engineering/tiffany-bao/>Tiffany Bao</a></h2><ul><li>Real world applications in cyber deception for security, seems to be a gap between the research in deception and real world applications.</li><li>The desires of security engineers and researchers investigating cyber deception are different, some want ease of use and others want more complex control over the environment.</li><li>To achieve both goals, developed the CDGym, based on the sdn network as well as plugins that define cyber deception strategies and network topology plugins.</li><li>Looking at the real world applications highlights the importance of practicality in using strategies for defense that work, example would be a defense strategy that recommends hiding the OS of an asset, but this might be unrealistic and impractical.</li><li>Existing models for defense deception don&rsquo;t take into account the practicality.

Significant difference in how attackers behave against deceptive agents, tend to be much more aggressive against deceptive networks, more scans, etc. Metrics of success are time duration, frustration, mistakes, etc. of the attacker.</li><li>Assumptions of attacker behavior are, knowing the value of a machine, knowing the attack graph, defenders knowing the attacker incentive and cost. Many of these aren&rsquo;t known exactly but can be predicted based on past behavior.</li><li>Question of whether or not it is possible to do deception when there are tight constraints on what is allowed of the changing network configuration, limitations on how it impacts the bandwidth of the system, etc.</li></ul><h1 id=new-directions-on-systems-and-algorithms-for-cyber-deception><strong>New Directions on Systems and Algorithms for Cyber Deception</strong></h1><h2 id=raj-boppanahttpwwwcsutsaedufacultyboppana><a href=http://www.cs.utsa.edu/faculty/boppana/>Raj Boppana</a></h2><p>Cyber Deception Using GPT</p><ul><li>Attacker provides the command and the LLM provides the attacker input as the prompt and some system information.

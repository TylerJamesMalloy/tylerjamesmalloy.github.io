Many believe that aspects of CAs such as meta cognition will emerge naturally from LLMs.</li><li><a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.11432.pdf>A survey on large language model based autonomous agents</a> <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.07864.pdf>The rise and potential of large language model based agents</a></li><li>Limitations of LLMs: No online learning, odd situation of being &lsquo;stuck&rsquo; in 2021. Bard doesn&rsquo;t quite have this issue. One of the points of the workshop is the promise of using cognitive architectures to benefit the limitations of LLMs, and vice-versa.</li><li>Q: What are the limitations of the use of transformers over RNNs which have seem to be no longer as relevant? A: Transformers appear to have some recurrent components, but they usually are not trained online, so there appear to be large wholes in GMs and what we want out of cognition.</li><li>Q: What is the status of the physical symbol system hypothesis: A Symbolic processing at some level is necessary but not sufficient. <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13150>Paul Rossenbloom&rsquo;s paper</a> goes into this question.</li></ul><h3 id=integrating-large-language-models-and-cognitive-architectures-exploring-synergistic-approaches-for-ai-agents-oscar-javier-romero-lópez-john-zimmerman-aaron-steinfeld-and-anthony-tomasic>Integrating Large Language Models and Cognitive Architectures: Exploring Synergistic Approaches for AI Agents: Oscar Javier Romero López, John Zimmerman, Aaron Steinfeld and Anthony Tomasic</h3><ul><li>Propose three methods of integrating LLMs into CAs. Nero-symbolic, modular, and agency approach.</li><li>Running example of cognitive agent application, assisting a blind person navigating.</li><li>Modular approach: Assumes the common model of cognition.</li><li>Cognitively augmented large language model. CA used to retrieve information about the semantic relationships if words in the context of a query, such as downtown, resolved based on time, contextual information<ul><li>This seems like an odd application given that LLMs are traditionally much better at referent resolution than CAs. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to just include that information into the LLM prompt?</li></ul></li><li>Leveraging LLMs to support multi-modal perception and action. Generate a semantic relationship of a prompt input that can be then used by a CA to do reasoning.</li><li>Semantic and episodic applications, automatically populate ontologies. Or generate ACT-R productions for a specific application</li><li>Internal simulation for anticipation and planning, using an LLM to chain sequences of events in a perception-action-perception. Ask what will happen next. Can use GPT to assign a probability of what till happen next based on context.</li><li>Neuro-symbolic approach: Clarion, focus on the action center subsystem, similar to the procedural memory of other cognitive architectures. Generate generalization or specialization rules that can be applied onto the clarion architecture.</li><li>Agency approach: Society of mind, Minsky. Many receiving agents that are receiving direction from the global work space. Agents play different roles, may focus on one aspect of the task, pairwise or supervisory role.</li><li>Multiple CA + LLMs interacting collaboratively to exchange knowledge and intentions with humans.</li></ul><p>Commonalities between all three aproaches, all use perception, action, and working memory. All use LLMs to convert symbols into natural language and vice-versa. Main difference between these approaches is the level of integration and the robustness. Neuro-symbolic is tightly integratesm agency is looselym and the modular is between the two.</p><p>tool former, how does this relate? Close to the modular approach in that we query external APIs.</p><h3 id=cognitive-architectures-for-language-agents-theodore-sumers-shunyu-yao--karthik-narasimhan-thomas-l-griffiths>Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents Theodore Sumers, Shunyu Yao, Karthik Narasimhan, Thomas L. Griffiths</h3><ul><li>Using language models to combine with value functions learned by robotic systems. Saycan and Generative agents. Interested in extending LLMs into different environments, different types of feedback goals for the agent, etc.</li><li>Newel and Simon thermostat agent control flow production system. We can think of language models as a distribution over productions. This conceptualizes prompt engineering as a bias over the initial distributions of productions, but all changes to the prompt impact the production, some in unforeseen ways.<ul><li>Shifted the posterior over productions by giving examples but there is no proof that we actually shifted the posterior. And the amount of the shift isn&rsquo;t quantifiable. How useful is this conceptualization?</li></ul></li><li>CoALA: Uses memory, action space, and decision spaces as a simplified architecture of cognition. Operates in the form of natural language instead of logical formulas.</li><li>Both external actions interacting with environments as well as internal actions involving reasoning, retrieval, and learning.</li><li>Decision making techniques: Output the action directly, output several actions and evaluate each, or generate many and simulate each iteratively in multiple steps. Ideally we can split these decisions into cycles of planning and execution.
SayCan Ahn 2022, ReAct Yao 2022, Voyager Wang 2023, Generative Agents Park 2023, Tree of thoughts 2023.</li><li>Gap in applications is updating agent code for decision-making. Learn new procedures.</li><li>CoALA abstractions to help develop language agents.</li><li>Raises questions of the role of memory in decision-making. Useful to think of committing memory to long term memory as an active decision making process.</li><li>Belief that more capabilities of large language models means there is less structure required, but there needs to be some architecture, some interface to a motor system or some action processing.</li></ul><h2 id=offline-integrations--content-david-reitter><strong>Offline Integrations / Content</strong> (David Reitter)</h2><h3 id=automating-knowledge-acquisition-for-content-centric-cognitive-agents-using-llms-sergei-nirenburg-sanjay-sarma-oruganti-venkata-jesse-english-and-marjorie-mcshane>Automating Knowledge Acquisition for Content-Centric Cognitive Agents Using LLMs: Sergei Nirenburg, Sanjay Sarma Oruganti Venkata, Jesse English and Marjorie McShane</h3><ul><li>Language endowed intelligent systems automatically collecting computational lexicons or ontologies.

My name is Tyler Malloy. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA. Prior to working at CMU I recieved my PhD in Cognitive Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute under the advisment of Chris R. Sims. In my current position, as during my degree, I study human and machine learning. One part of my research is in cognitive modelling, studying how humans learn and make decisions, particularly how they represent visual information while achieving these goals.</description></item></channel></rss>

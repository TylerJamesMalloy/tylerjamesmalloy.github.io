It was a great experience and I tired to attend every lecture and find the papers that were discussed during them. Some of the
Keynote: Bart Preneel (KU Leuven) Discussion on the goals and realities of privacy policy implementations with examples from history of the 3 major &amp;lsquo;privacy wars&amp;rsquo;, their causes and impacts on public policy of privacy and security.</description></item><item><title>Security and Human Behaviour 2023</title><link>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/shb-2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/shb-2023/</guid><description>The following are my notes taken during the SHB workshop. I have included the names of presenters but it should be noted that these are my own general thoughs and reactions while attending these presentations, and not necessarily the views and opinions of the presenters.
Session 1: Privacy Lorrie Cranor: Designing Visable and Useful Privacy Icons: Privacy &amp;rsquo;nutrition labels&amp;rsquo; can be used to inform the public on their privacy concerns. 2020: App security labels tested, many instances of confusion from participants.</description></item><item><title>NeurIPS 2022</title><link>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/neurips-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/neurips-2022/</guid><description>This year I attended the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems for the first time to present a poster alongside a paper that was accepted at the workshop on Information Theoretic Principles in Cognitive Systems.
The first day fo the conference I attended the NewInML workshop, which was intended for researchers that are new to the machine learning community. Since this was my first NeurIPS and my background is in cognitive science, this felt like the perfect way to start the conference.</description></item><item><title>AAAI 2021</title><link>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/aaai-2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/aaai-2021/</guid><description>This is the second post in a series of retrospectives on previous work I have done that shaped my PhD and are related to my future research goals. If you would like to read the paper you can find it on my Researchgate.
Although this paper is relatively recent, I thought I would use it as my second post because it is closely realted to a project that I began soon after beginning my AI Researcher position with IBM in early 2019.</description></item></channel></rss>

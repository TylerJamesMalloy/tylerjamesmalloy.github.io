During my PhD, I had shyed away from the more complex topics in cognitive modeling, such as meta learning. This decision was in part motivated by my interests in understanding the most basic and fundamental aspects of human and machine learning. Another aspect of this decision was the increased difficulty and potential problems that are associated with designing more complex tasks.</description></item></channel></rss>

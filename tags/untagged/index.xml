The entire abstract I submitted is copied at the bottom of this blog post if you would like to read it.
The VSS experience was very positive, I was somewhat worried or hesitant that I would not get a lot of the posters and talks since my experience is much more in the learning domain rather than vision.</description></item></channel></rss>

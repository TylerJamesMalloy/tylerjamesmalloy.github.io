In this work, the authors provide a broad perspective on reinforcement learning research and put forward the opinion that much of the behavior that interests cognitive science and artificial intelligence researchers can be viewed in relation to reward. Specifically, they propose that many cognitive faculties such as perception, language, generalization, imitation, and even general intelligence can be achieved through reward maximization and experience in an environment.</description></item></channel></rss>

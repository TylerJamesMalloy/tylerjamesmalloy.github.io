What do we now know that we didn&amp;rsquo;t at the beginning of the MURI.
How do we make HATs resilient, rather than just focusing on the performance of the AI model alone. Human decision errors are often due to biases and AI models should take those into account.

One purpose of the workshop was to center human behavior and decision making in the discussion on where to take research into cyber deception. From my perspective, the future of cyber deception will involve in some way human decision making, whether as human in the loop systems or human on the loop systems, or as a reviewer and analyzer of the behavior of automated systems.</description></item><item><title>IEEE S&amp;P 2023</title><link>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/ieee-snp-2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/ieee-snp-2023/</guid><description>The following are my notes that I took during the IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy. It was a great experience and I tired to attend every lecture and find the papers that were discussed during them. Some of the

I think it was a great experience for myself, as I had little previous work as a direct mentor, and hopefully the mentees felt the same way. The remainder of this blog post is some reflections from my experience as a mentor and the life lessons I have thought of and tried to discuss with them.</description></item></channel></rss>

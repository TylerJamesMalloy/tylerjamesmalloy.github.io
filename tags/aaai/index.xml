This was an exciting series for me to see since I have written multiple blog posts on this site about LLMs, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought deeply on how to apply them to cognitive models. LLMs definitely have been an interest of mine, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had a good reason to push for their integration in the models that we work with.</description></item><item><title>AAAI 2021</title><link>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/aaai-2021/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/aaai-2021/</guid><description>This is the second post in a series of retrospectives on previous work I have done that shaped my PhD and are related to my future research goals. If you would like to read the paper you can find it on my Researchgate.
Although this paper is relatively recent, I thought I would use it as my second post because it is closely realted to a project that I began soon after beginning my AI Researcher position with IBM in early 2019.</description></item></channel></rss>

This was an exciting series for me to see since I have written multiple blog posts on this site about LLMs, but hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought deeply on how to apply them to cognitive models. LLMs definitely have been an interest of mine, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t had a good reason to push for their integration in the models that we work with.</description></item></channel></rss>

While this area of research has been in the news signifcantly recently, it is not exatly my area. However, there was a talk at the University of Pittsburgh philosophy department given by professor Colin Allen that was, at least partially, presented as a refutation to the position of David Chalmers that I discussed previously. Since I talked about Chalmers&amp;rsquo; ideas in my previous blog post, I thought this would serve as a nice contrast to those ideas, and hopefully wrap up my thinking about it for the time being.</description></item></channel></rss>

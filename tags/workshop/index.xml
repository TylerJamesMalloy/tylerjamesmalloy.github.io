One purpose of the workshop was to center human behavior and decision making in the discussion on where to take research into cyber deception. From my perspective, the future of cyber deception will involve in some way human decision making, whether as human in the loop systems or human on the loop systems, or as a reviewer and analyzer of the behavior of automated systems.</description></item></channel></rss>

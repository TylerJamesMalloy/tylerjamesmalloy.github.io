This point of view may not be the most common among either psychologists or computer scientists, but it would be great news for reinforcement learning researchers who are interested in making very smart systems by training them to maximize reward.</description></item><item><title>Rl Web Security</title><link>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/rl-web-security/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tylerjamesmalloy.github.io/posts/rl-web-security/</guid><description>Since my partner is a web security expert, I often end up having long discussions about internet security, even though my personal knowledge and research is in a very different area. That has recently gotten us to thinking about the intersection of reinforcement learning and web security. Though at first these may seem like two disparate areas, as anyone who has had experience talking at length with another person about their specific research area will know, eventually there are many commonalities that can be found between the two.</description></item></channel></rss>

This post is a continuation of a previous post on measures of similarity in cognitive models. This post is inspired by the recent preprint that I released called ['Leveraging a Cognitive Model to Measure Subjective Similarity of Human and GPT-4 Written Content'](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/383701858_Leveraging_a_Cognitive_Model_to_Measure_Subjective_Similarity_of_Human_and_GPT-4_Written_Content).

 In this work, we develop a method for estimating human's subjective similarity using a cognitive model. Similarity between stimuli has been a major theme in my research, and it is a major challenge to cognitive modeling in general. In this post I will detail the importance of metrics of similarity that accurately reflect how humans perceive the similarity of stimuli they are presented with. I will focus on Instance Based Learning models, and in a later post discuss how similarity is relevant for Reinforcement Learning models and how we apply Generative AI representations onto determining similarity.

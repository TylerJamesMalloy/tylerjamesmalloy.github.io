I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA. Prior to working at CMU I recieved my PhD in Cognitive Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute under the advisment of Chris R. Sims. In my current position, as during my degree, I study human and machine learning. One part of my research is in cognitive modelling, studying how humans learn and make decisions, particularly how they represent visual information while achieving these goals. My research in artificial intelligence focuses on human-inspired reinforcement learning, which was a project I worked on as a part of a scholarship funded by IBM Research AI.</p><h2 id=this-blog>This Blog</h2><p>The posts on this blog are a variety of retrospectives on my previous research projects and how they relate to my future research interests, reviews and opinions on the work of other researchers, and personal plans and journals of my life events. Everything written on this page is the opinion of myself and has no connection to any buisness or organization.</p><h2 id=other-sites>Other Sites:</h2><p>For all of the papers that I have released online see my <a href=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tyler-Malloy>research gate profile</a> and my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gNvshb4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">google scholar profile</a>.

And finally for more personal general information you can see my <a href=https://twitter.com/TylerJMalloy>twitter account</a>. There is also my <a href=https://github.com/TylerJamesMalloy>github account</a> which has my personal projects and some research projects that can be made available.</p><h2 id=personal>Personal:</h2><p>I was born in a small town outside of Boston Massachusetts and moved to Vancouver in 2013 to attend university at UBC, where I studied cognitive systems and philosophy. After university I began my PhD at RPI and moved to Troy where I have been ever since, other than a brief internship in Yorktown NY at IBM. In December of 2022 I moved to Pittsburgh to begin the next stage of my research career as a postdoctoral researcher at CMU. My hobbies include cooking, eating out at restaurants, reading science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy, and playing video, card (Magic the Gathering), and board games.</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-tag meta-icon"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2h10l8.59 8.59a2 2 0 010 2.82z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg>

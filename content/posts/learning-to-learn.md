One interesting development in my research interests is the unexpected focus on 'learning to learn' that many of my recent papers and projects have been focused on. During my PhD, I had shyed away from the more complex topics in cognitive modeling, such as meta learning. This decision was in part motivated by my interests in understanding the most basic and fundamental aspects of human and machine learning. Another aspect of this decision was the increased difficulty and potential problems that are associated with designing more complex tasks. 

The overall motivation behind much of my research is in bridging the gap between the understanding of how the human mind functions in reality, and how we choose to design machine learning methods. The hope is that through an increased understanding of how the human mind achieve behavioral goals, we can design more human-like machine learning methods that better reflect cognative realities. However, this motivation presupposes the usefulness of machine learning methods that are similar to the human mind. 

The simplest justification for designing human-like ML is that humans excell at a variety of tasks, such as learning to learn, and if we can build ML models that 

While many recent methods in machine learning, as well as classical approaches, do draw heavily from motivations related to human learning, much of the recent success in areas like Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to go against what we know about human learning and behavior. 

One of the most relevant aspects of recent ML methods is the overparameterization 

Related to this issue of whether the human brain is overparameterized is the question of the source of meta-cognitive abilities in the human brain and ML methods. LLMs have been suggested to have meta-cognitive abilities even though they were not trained explicitly to produce meta-cognition. This raises the question of whether faculties like transfer of learning in humans emerge as a natural result of our brains being trained and optimized through evolution (though thinking of evolution as a direct optimizing force or process is not correct) and experience to achieve some goal distinct from meta-cognition

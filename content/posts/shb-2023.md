The following are my notes taken during the SHB workshop. I have included the names of presenters but it should be noted that these are my own general thoughs and reactions while attending these presentations, and not necessarily the views and opinions of the presenters. 

## Day 1
### Session 1: Privacy 
- **Lorrie Cranor**: Designing Visable and Useful Privacy Icons: 
- **Laura Brandimarte**: Parental Trust and Automated Detection of Cyber Predators: One issue with the use of tools to ensure protection against cyber predators is algorithm aversion in the general public. People often feel like they are a part of a unique group who may be unjustly harmed by the application of algorithms, even though many people agree that the general public should have trust in algorithms. This can introduce challenges in the detection of online predation as parents may not trust algorithms to handle their children's interactions online.

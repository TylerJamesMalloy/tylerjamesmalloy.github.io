## About Me! 

My name is Tyler Malloy. I am currently a PhD student studying human and machine learning at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. One part of my research is in cognitive modelling, studying how humans learn and make decisions, particularly how they represent visual information while achieving these goals. My research in artificial intelligence focuses on human-inspired reinforcement learning, which is the project I am currently working on as a part of a scholarship funded by IBM Research AI.

In December of 2022 I will be beginning a postdoctoral research position at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh PA. I will be working under the advisment of Professor Cleotilde Gonzalez the Dynamic Decision Making lab in the department of Social and Decision Sciences within the Dietrich College. I hope to continue my work in cognitive modelling, extending my research into multi-player environments and real world application settings like cyber-defense. 

## This Blog 

The posts on this blog are a variety of retrospectives on my previous research projects and how they relate to my future research interests, reviews and opinions on the work of other researchers, and personal plans and journals of my life events. Everything written on this page is the opinion of myself and has no connection to any buisness or organization.

## Personal: 

I was born in a small town outside of Boston Massachusetts and moved to Vancouver in 2013 to attend university at UBC, where I studied cognitive systems and philosophy. After university I began my PhD at RPI and moved to Troy where I have been ever since, other than a brief internship in Yorktown NY at IBM. In December of 2022 I will be moving to Pittsburgh to begin the next stage of my research career as a postdoctoral researcher at CMU. My hobbies include cooking, eating out at restaurants, reading science fiction, fantasy, and philosophy, and playing video, card (Magic the Gathering), and board games.
